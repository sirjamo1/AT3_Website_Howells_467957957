                    <p>
                        Hi, my name is Maurice Lidman and my background is in
                        boxing. I competed as an amateur in my early years and
                        now like to share my knowledge and expertise as a coach.
                        It is not unknown for me to jump into the ring as your
                        sparring partner.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For over three decades Maurice has been involved in the
                        boxing scene. He has competed as an amateur in his early
                        years and now shares his knowledge and expertise as a
                        coach, by running his boxing classes with passion and
                        enthusiasm.
                    </p>
